<h1 align="center"> :microphone: TALKS :microphone: </h1>

### Some of my talks and a little more :P

Comes with a [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) skeleton in the form of [talk.md](./talk.md) and a (maybe) handy util in the form of [`./talk`](./talk)

All the talks are in the `reveal-md` format inside `src`.

You can also run `./talk help` to see all available options.

Have a nice day :baby_chick:
